The template showed sizes and colors and I had to recreate the same design. 
The Background image was taken from the template as well.

# Getting Started
If you are interested in setting up this repository locally in your machine, I suggest you to follow next steps:
- Choose the repository and fork it to your Github account. It will create a copy of this repository.
- Choose a folder in your local machine where you want this repository to be copied.
- Afterwards open the terminal in your machine and get ready to clone repository. Make sure you direct your machine to the folder which you created for the repository.
- Run the clone command
- Make sure to attach link to the command that is generated in your forked repository and not in the main one. It should look similar to this git clone https://github.com/smithj/azure-docs.git
- Enter your github credentials if prompted.
- The clone command runs and downloads a copy of forked repository in your machine locally.
- Now You can explore the folder, see structure, check the code and write any changes if you want.
